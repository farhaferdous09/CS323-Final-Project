# CS323-Final-Project
Logistic Regression

In this project, I implement a Logistic Regression model applied to synthetic data classification.

The project focuses on:

• Generating synthetic classification data using make_classification and adding noise to assess model robustness.
• Training and tuning a logistic regression model with hyperparameter optimization using grid search.
• Evaluating performance based on multiple metrics, including time complexity, space complexity, and predictive accuracy.
• Benchmarking the model's performance by analyzing its scalability with different data sizes and feature configurations.
• Visualizing results, including confusion matrix, feature importance, and learning curves
